# naudio-multitrack-recorder
based on mark heath's project [.NET voice recorder], using naudio, this modified project allows rudimentary configuring and recording from two recording inputs on Windows 7 &amp; 10 at the least... check Wiki for more iNfo!

If you are interested in just trying the project, download the contents of the bin/debug folder at : https://github.com/dave-gu/naudio-multitrack-recorder/tree/master/bin/Debug
Run VoiceRecorder.exe
Select your two inputs.
Etc.
After concluding usage of the program the .wav files will be located, timestamped, in the program directory.
